As our GTM AI Operator, you’ll help build, configure, and continuously improve these agents. You’ll work at the intersection of data, automation, and human workflows — designing how our “AI brain” learns and operates in the real world.
You’ll focus on both how our AI systems connect and run and how they learn and improve over time.
What You’ll Do
AI Agent Design & Deployment — Build and configure AI agents in low-code environments (e.g., Relevance AI, Make, Zapier, Retool) to support use cases like prospecting, lead follow-up, and customer enablement.
Training & Optimization — Refine prompts, tune logic, and monitor AI agent performance. Identify hallucinations and continuously improve accuracy.
Workflow Integration — Connect AI agents into GTM systems like Salesforce, HubSpot, and Gainsight; ensure clean data flow and reliable handoffs.
Feedback Loops & Governance — Establish testing, QA, and retraining cycles to ensure consistent performance.
Cross-Functional Collaboration — Partner with Sales, Marketing, and Product teams to prioritize use cases and measure impact.
Innovation & Experimentation — Stay current on emerging AI tools and techniques; test and scale new use cases quickly
What You Bring
2–5 years in RevOps, BizOps, Automation, or GTM Systems roles.
Experience working with low-code or no-code automation platforms (Zapier, Make, Retool, Relevance AI, etc.).
Familiarity with LLMs and prompt design — not to build models, but to operationalize them.
Comfort with light scripting (Python or JavaScript) or data tools (SQL, Excel).
Excellent documentation and cross-team communication skills.
Curious, iterative, and self-starting mindset — you love figuring out how systems work and how to make them better.
Why This Role Rocks
You’ll be our first-ever AI Enablement hire—building something meaningful from scratch.
You’ll help define how AI supports our GTM engine across Support, Customer Success, Marketing, and Sales.
You’ll work with RevOps, Product, Sales, and Support teams to drive real impact—fast.
The role is high-visibility and high-growth and will evolve as fast as the AI space does.
Let’s be real: your job will literally be to make robots smarter.

You could work anywhere. Why us?
Join a pre-IPO startup with capital, traction and runway ($240M funded | 60X revenue growth in 5 years | $2T market size)
Partner with our VP of BizOps & Analytics, Armando La Rocca (ex-BCG, Better)
Disrupt a massive market and take us to a $10B business in the next few years
Be immersed in a talent-dense environment and greatly accelerate your career growth
About The Opportunity
Jerry is looking for a Senior Associate, Business Operations to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years — scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a Senior Associate, Business Operations, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company’s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the business operations & analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.
Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible – insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc – a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we’ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot & voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.
Here's what an ex-McKinsey teammate has to say about joining Jerry:
""I’ve really enjoyed working at Jerry because it’s allowed me to flex the strategy muscles I built at McKinsey while also getting much closer to implementation. Unlike traditional consulting, I’m not just handing off a recommendation — I actually get to own the metrics, design A/B tests, and see how our strategies play out in the real world.
Jerry has a deeply data-driven culture. We A/B test everything, and there’s been a big investment in data infrastructure — from clean, well-structured data to a strong data engineering team that supports real decision-making. As a result, the data and BizOps team is seen as a core strategic partner within the company.
Another thing I’ve appreciated is the team itself. A lot of people here come from MBB, so I’ve still got the energy, sharp thinking, and high bar that I had at McKinsey — but now I also get to build, test, and iterate on the strategies I help develop. It’s a great mix of ownership, rigor, and impact.""
How You Will Make An Impact
Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies
Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies
Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth
Identify opportunities to automate manual processes and optimize operational efficiency 
Preferred Experience
Bachelor’s degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline
2+ years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in business analysis/operations
High level of comfort with SQL and/or running complex data analysis
Who You Are
You have a framework for problem solving and live by first principles
You are comfortable communicating with audiences varying from front-line employees to the company’s C-suite
You set a very high bar for yourself and for your team, and you are constantly pushing that bar higher in the pursuit of excellence
