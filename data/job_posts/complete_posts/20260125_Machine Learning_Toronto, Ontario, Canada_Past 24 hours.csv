Our org covers multiple disciplines including silicon engineering, hardware design and verification, software, and operations. AWS Nitro, ENA, EFA, Graviton and F1 EC2 Instances, AWS Neuron, Inferentia and Trainium ML Accelerators, and in storage with scalable NVMe, are some of the products we have delivered over the last few years.
Within this ecosystem, the Neuron Compiler team is developing a deep learning compiler stack that takes state of the art LLM, Vision, and multi-modal models created in frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX, and makes them run performantly on our accelerators. The team is comprised of some of the brightest minds in the engineering, research, and product communities, focused on the ambitious goal of creating a toolchain that will provide a quantum leap in performance.
The Neuron team is hiring systems and compiler engineers in order to solve our customers toughest problems. Specifically, the performance team in Toronto is focused on analysis and optimization of system-level performance of machine learning models on AWS ML accelerators. The team conducts in-depth profiling and works across multiple layers of the technology stack - from frameworks and compilers to runtime and collectives - to meet and exceed customer requirements while maintaining a competitive edge in the market. As part of the Neuron Compiler organization, the team not only identifies and implements performance optimizations but also works to crystallize these improvements into the compiler, automating optimizations for broader customer benefit.
This is an opportunity to work on products at the intersection of machine-learning, high-performance computing, and distributed architectures. You will architect and implement business-critical features, publish research, and mentor a brilliant team of experienced engineers. We operate in spaces that are very large, yet our teams remain small and agile. There is no blueprint. We're inventing. We're experimenting. It is a very unique learning culture.

Job Description
Department Overview
Building a World-Class Technology Team at TD
We can't afford to be boring. Neither can you. The scale and scope of what TD does may surprise you. The rapid pace of change makes it a business imperative for us to be smart and open-minded in the way we think about technology. TD's technology and business teams become more intertwined as new opportunities present themselves. This new era in banking does not equal boring. Not at TD, anyway.
TD Testing and Quality Engineer (QE) covers a specialized area dedicated to high-quality application and solution delivery. Similar to industry trends, TD's definition of this area of discipline (as well as skill and knowledge requirements) has changed over time. One thing hasn't changed – experts in this area remain highly-marketable across businesses.
Some of our testing activities may focus on system integration, business acceptance, performance, operability and deployment verification.

Stay current with the latest advancements in AI infrastructure, frameworks, and platforms to inform product decisions
Develop and execute go-to-market strategies for AI software products that leverage Lemurian's compiler and optimization capabilities
What You'll Bring
6+ years of product management experience in AI, cloud platforms, or developer tools
Deep understanding of AI model development, inference, and training platforms
Experience with AI workloads and infrastructure requirements for large-scale deployments
Strong technical knowledge of compilers, AI frameworks (TensorFlow/JAX, PyTorch, Triton, XLA, etc.), and cloud-native technologies
Ability to translate customer needs into actionable product features and drive execution in collaboration with engineering teams
Excellent communication skills with a proven ability to engage with technical and non-technical stakeholders
Track record of shipping successful products in fast-paced environments
Nice to have
Prior experience working in a high-growth startup environment
Hands-on experience with Python programming
Familiarity with cloud-native technologies (Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform) and optimization techniques for scalable AI workloads
Experience with GPU architectures and performance optimization
Background in developer tools or infrastructure products
Contributions to open-source AI or infrastructure projects
Personal Attributes
Customer-obsessed — you deeply understand user needs and build products people love
Self-driven — you take ownership and don't wait for permission to solve problems
Collaborative mindset — you work well across teams and help others succeed
Passionate about sustainability — you care about making AI more efficient and environmentally responsible
Clear communicator — you can explain complex technical concepts to both engineers and stakeholders
Strategic thinker — you balance long-term vision with near-term execution
Salary depends on experience and geographical location. 
This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, such as the candidate’s experience, knowledge, skills, and abilities, as well as internal equity among our team. 
Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus opportunities, medical, dental, and vision benefits; retirement savings plan; and supplemental wellness benefits.
Lemurian Labs ensures equal employment opportunity without discrimination or harassment based on race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, national origin, marital or domestic/civil partnership status, genetic information, citizenship status, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.
