We’re weaving AI into the fabric of our GTM motion—support, success, sales, marketing—and looking for someone to help us get it right (not ""kind of right,"" like a ChatGPT recipe for beef wellington. Actually right.)
This is a hybrid position where you'll be required to be in office at least two days a week with the flexibility to work from home the remaining days if desired.
About The Role:
We’re building our first AI Workforce — a collection of intelligent agents that help Sales, Marketing, and Customer Success work smarter and faster.
As our GTM AI Operator, you’ll help build, configure, and continuously improve these agents. You’ll work at the intersection of data, automation, and human workflows — designing how our “AI brain” learns and operates in the real world.
You’ll focus on both how our AI systems connect and run and how they learn and improve over time.

About Us: 
At Lemurian Labs, we’re reimagining the foundations of computing to make AI accessible to everyone. Our mission is to remove the limits of scale, hardware, and cost that hold back innovation, so the people solving humanity’s hardest problems can move faster.
We’re building a new kind of software stack: a hardware-agnostic platform that makes every system - from a laptop to a supercomputer - feel like one seamless engine. Developers can write once, run anywhere, and get state-of-the-art performance across any chip, any cloud, any scale. It’s a complete rethink of how software and hardware interact—designed for the era beyond Moore’s Law.
We’re not looking for the comfortable or the conventional; we’re looking for the bold. The engineers who crave frontier problems, who want to bend the limits of what’s possible, who see infrastructure not as a constraint but as a canvas. If you want to build the foundation for the next era of AI, and change what humanity can achieve in the process, join us.
About Us: 
We're looking for a Technical Product Manager who will work closely with our founders to shape, design, and execute the product strategy behind our next-gen AI platform. 
This is not a typical PM role. You’ll be working at the intersection of compilers, distributed runtimes, and developer experience, translating frontier technology into products that redefine how developers and enterprises train and serve AI models at scale. You will collaborate with teams cross-functionally to define what gets built, why it matters, and how it benefits our customers. 
You will be responsible for driving clarity in times of ambiguity, scoping complex work, validating product hypotheses, defining testable outcomes, and other related tasks. This is a high-impact, zero-to-one role for someone who thrives on building deeply technical products from first principles and wants to help reshape the future of AI infrastructure. 
You will want this role if you’re someone who loves operating at the edge of technology, product, and design, while obsessing over architecture, user experience, and adoption, and who wants to leave a lasting impact on how the world builds and deploys AI
What You'll Do
Identify and analyze AI workloads across various industries, understanding the infrastructure needs for large-scale model builders and enterprise AI teams
Define strategies for optimizing AI workloads using Lemurian's software stack, ensuring seamless integration with existing tools
Work closely with engineering teams to build products that accelerate AI development and deployment
Engage directly with enterprise AI teams, model builders, and developers to gather insights and translate them into impactful product features
Collaborate cross-functionally with engineering, marketing, and sales to ensure alignment and drive successful product adoption
Define and track key metrics to measure the impact of Lemurian's AI software solutions and drive continuous improvements
Stay current with the latest advancements in AI infrastructure, frameworks, and platforms to inform product decisions
Develop and execute go-to-market strategies for AI software products that leverage Lemurian's compiler and optimization capabilities
What You'll Bring
6+ years of product management experience in AI, cloud platforms, or developer tools
Deep understanding of AI model development, inference, and training platforms
Experience with AI workloads and infrastructure requirements for large-scale deployments
Strong technical knowledge of compilers, AI frameworks (TensorFlow/JAX, PyTorch, Triton, XLA, etc.), and cloud-native technologies
Ability to translate customer needs into actionable product features and drive execution in collaboration with engineering teams
Excellent communication skills with a proven ability to engage with technical and non-technical stakeholders
Track record of shipping successful products in fast-paced environments
Nice to have
Prior experience working in a high-growth startup environment
Hands-on experience with Python programming
Familiarity with cloud-native technologies (Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform) and optimization techniques for scalable AI workloads
Experience with GPU architectures and performance optimization
Background in developer tools or infrastructure products
Contributions to open-source AI or infrastructure projects
Personal Attributes
Customer-obsessed — you deeply understand user needs and build products people love
Self-driven — you take ownership and don't wait for permission to solve problems
Collaborative mindset — you work well across teams and help others succeed
Passionate about sustainability — you care about making AI more efficient and environmentally responsible
Clear communicator — you can explain complex technical concepts to both engineers and stakeholders
Strategic thinker — you balance long-term vision with near-term execution

Customer expectations in support have reached new heights while the industry struggles with mounting complexity. Today's customers demand AI-driven, immediate resolutions, yet most companies remain stuck in pilot phases, unable to convert AI potential into measurable results. The challenge is intensifying. Industry projections suggest that by 2029, agentic systems will autonomously handle the majority of routine issues, creating a widening chasm between what customers expect and what organizations currently deliver.
Our approach bridges this divide through a hybrid model: AI-enhanced ""cyborg"" agents who combine sophisticated troubleshooting expertise with product knowledge and agentic AI capabilities. In this position, you will train, refine, and mentor the tools themselves. Each resolution you engineer strengthens our automation framework, every root cause investigation becomes a repeatable pattern, and each edge case you decode enhances system intelligence for thousands of future customers. This is the intersection of advanced diagnostics, human judgment, and AI orchestration—delivering rapid resolutions now while building compounding intelligence for the future.
This position centers on hands-on problem resolution at production scale. You will investigate ambiguous failures spanning networks, databases, cloud infrastructure, and enterprise applications; harness AI to generate hypotheses, validate theories, and accelerate diagnosis; capture the human reasoning that educates our systems; and proactively identify patterns that transform isolated fixes into lasting automation. This is not about following scripts, sorting tickets, or escalating to Level 3. If you excel at lateral thinking when documentation is sparse, if you can transition seamlessly from packet analysis to query optimization to workflow tracing, and if you're prepared to challenge an LLM's conclusions, this role will suit you.
What You Will Be Doing
AI-Enhanced Customer Resolution: Investigate sophisticated tickets escalated from AI systems, deploy human expertise in areas where AI capabilities remain limited, and subsequently enhance the AI system to narrow that gap
What You Won’t Be Doing
Spending two full months on onboarding; you will be expected to achieve proficiency across multiple products within the first month (we recognize this is an aggressive timeline)
Depending on your managers for assistance; if you cannot effectively unblock yourself, this role will present significant challenges
Application Support Engineer Key Responsibilities
Combine technical human judgment and AI capability to provide outstanding customer support, concentrating on sophisticated issues that AI cannot yet completely resolve
Basic Requirements
Must be located in North or South America
Minimum of 3 years total experience in a technical customer support position
Fundamental coding ability for troubleshooting and bug resolution purposes
Advanced proficiency with generative AI (i.e., experience with multiple AI platforms, capability to automate workflows and build custom GPTs); if your LLM usage is limited to research, learning, brainstorming, or content creation, that will be considered insufficient
Troubleshooting Capabilities: Articulating complex issues in accessible language, demonstrating thorough problem comprehension, recommending appropriate troubleshooting approaches, suggesting multiple solution alternatives, and exhibiting meticulous attention to detail

Incept: A content generation platform producing all personalized educational content for multiple learning applications deployed at Alpha School.
Crossover: An AI-powered hiring platform processing tens of thousands of applicants monthly, staffing schools and companies worldwide.
You will take ownership of one platform and dedicate the majority of your time to building its most complex components with a small team (3-5 senior engineers, no juniors). The architectural choices you make determine whether other teams can build new applications quickly, integrate smoothly, and deliver value to students. Strong decisions unlock massive leverage. Poor decisions generate integration failures and destroy velocity across multiple teams.

Technical Leadership: Drive strategic architectural decisions and define technical patterns the team will follow.
AI Leadership: Champion the adoption of emerging AI workflows and develop high-impact playbooks.
Implementation: Construct the complex, mission-critical components of the codebase with your team.

"L2 Support Engineer, Alpha (Remote) - $60,000/year USD ",Crossover ,"Toronto, ON (Remote)",2026-01-26 06:31:00,17 hours ago,False,,https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Ecrossover%2Ecom%2Froles%2Fa0sfv000001GOfJAAW%2Fl2-support-engineer%2Fapply%3Futm_source%3Dlinkedin%26utm_medium%3Djobslot%26utm_campaign%3DLJ-5729-CA-Toronto-L2SupportEngin&urlhash=rrd2&isSdui=true,"About the job
Educational support organizations face mounting complexity while schools, students, and families demand increasingly rapid responses. Schools require immediate, AI-powered assistance spanning learning platforms, student information systems, device management, and operational workflows. Yet most teams remain trapped in siloed tools, manual handoffs, and fragile processes that buckle under production pressure.
We bridge this divide through a fundamentally reimagined approach: AI-enhanced ""cyborg"" agents positioned at the heart of a living educational infrastructure. In this position, you will influence how the system evolves. Each resolution strengthens future automation, each root cause investigation refines process and policy, and each edge case you decode improves outcomes for thousands of students and educators.
This is production-grade, hands-on troubleshooting within a service context. You will investigate ambiguous, multi-party failures spanning learning applications, student information systems, identity infrastructure, network layers, and operational processes; use AI to generate hypotheses, validate approaches, and accelerate resolution; capture the human reasoning that trains both systems and colleagues; and surface patterns that transform isolated fixes into sustainable, organization-wide enhancements.
This is not about ticket sorting, script execution, or ""escalate and wait."" If you excel when documentation is sparse, when issues cross engineering, operations, and academic domains, and when you can transition from technical diagnosis to stakeholder coordination without sacrificing precision, this role will suit you well.
What You Will Be Doing
AI-Augmented Customer Resolutions: Investigate complex tickets escalated from AI systems, deploy human judgment where AI capabilities fall short, and subsequently enhance the AI system by addressing those gaps
What You Won’t Be Doing
Spending two full months on onboarding; you will be expected to achieve proficiency across multiple products within the first month (we recognize this timeline is ambitious)
Depending on managers for unblocking; if you are not skilled at removing your own obstacles, you will likely find this role challenging
L2 Support Engineer Key Responsibilities
Combine technical human judgment with AI capabilities to provide exceptional customer support, concentrating on sophisticated issues that AI cannot yet independently resolve
Basic Requirements
Must be located in North or South America
Minimum of 3 years total experience in a technical customer support role
Fundamental coding skills for troubleshooting and bug resolution purposes
Advanced generative AI proficiency (i.e., use of multiple AI tools, ability to automate workflows and custom GPTs); if you have only used LLMs for research, learning, brainstorming, or content generation, that will be considered insufficient
Troubleshooting Skills: Translating complex issues into simple terms, demonstrating robust problem comprehension, recommending appropriate troubleshooting strategies, proposing multiple solution paths, and displaying attention to detail

We are expanding platforms relied upon by thousands of students and teams:
TimeBack: Educational platform driving Alpha School's 2-hour learning model (99th percentile test results).
Incept: Content generation platform producing all personalized educational materials for multiple learning applications deployed at Alpha School.
Crossover: AI-powered hiring platform handling tens of thousands of applicants monthly, staffing schools and companies worldwide.
You will take ownership of one platform and dedicate the majority of your time to constructing the most complex components of the codebase with a compact team (3-5 experienced engineers, no junior members). The architectural choices you make will dictate whether other teams can quickly build new applications, integrate seamlessly, and deliver value to students. Correct decisions unlock massive leverage. Poor decisions generate integration failures and destroy velocity across multiple teams.
You design, build, and operate your own work. You set quality standards and define patterns for your platform. Our approach is spec-driven: design precedes implementation, planning comes before building. Expect high autonomy, no committees, no approval boards. You work within a small, focused team where accountability for what you deliver rests with you.
What You Will Be Doing
Technical Leadership: Formulate strategic architectural choices and define technical patterns for the team to adopt.
AI Leadership: Champion the adoption of emerging AI workflows and produce high-impact playbooks.
Implementation: Construct the intricate, high-stakes components of the codebase working directly with your team.
Quality Reviews: Verify your team adheres to established patterns and upholds quality standards.
What You Won’t Be Doing
Serving as an architect without hands-on implementation
Spending time trapped in endless meetings
Managing people (this role focuses on technical leadership, not personnel management)

At Shakudo, we’re building the world’s first operating system for data and AI. We use the term “operating system” in the truest sense: just like iOS, Windows, or Linux, Shakudo’s end-to-end OS provides ever-evolving, fully automated, best-in-class open-source components tailored to each business’s unique needs.
We are seeking a seasoned Engagement Manager to join our team and play a critical role in driving customer success while shaping the future of AI adoption in the enterprise. The ideal candidate will have a strong background in customer management, with experience in enterprise software or technical consulting.
This role involves owning customer engagements from kickoff to delivery, working cross-functionally with internal teams, and partnering closely with technical and executive stakeholders. At Shakudo, our culture is proactive, collaborative, and supportive—we succeed together by building strong partnerships and solving complex challenges.
Responsibilities
Collaborate with customer executives and technical teams to identify critical pain points and areas where Shakudo can provide the greatest impact.
Define and develop high-value use cases through deep customer engagement.
Partner with top-tier machine learning, product, engineering, and business teams across industries to design and refine AI and data applications that drive measurable business value.
Oversee project delivery: manage timelines, coordinate internal resources, and ensure high-quality deliverables.
Present results and lead strategic sessions for future opportunities, engaging audiences from engineers to C-suite executives.
Safeguard long-term customer relationships by proactively identifying and addressing risks or concerns.
Establish effective feedback loops between customers and Shakudo’s product, engineering, and go-to-market teams.
Develop strategies to standardize engagement processes and scale learnings to benefit future customers.
Qualifications
5+ years in management consulting, customer engagement, or similar roles.
2+ years of direct technical experience or close collaboration with engineering teams on technical projects.
Strong leadership, communication, and presentation skills, with the ability to influence cross-functional stakeholders at all levels.
Deep understanding of data and AI technologies and their applications in enterprise contexts.
Proven ability to thrive in fast-paced, ambiguous, and unstructured environments.
Adaptive, curious, and collaborative, willing to learn, lead, guide, and follow as needed.
A plus
Experience with programming, scripting or statistical packages (e.g. Python, R, Matlab, SQL)
Why Shakudo Stands Out
Work with cutting-edge technologies in machine learning and high-performance computing.
Contribute to a platform that transforms how organizations leverage data and AI.
Join a dynamic team that values innovation, efficiency, and diversity.
Thrive in an inclusive environment—Shakudo is an equal opportunity employer and welcomes candidates from all backgrounds and experiences.
Shakudo offers a high-impact package: competitive salary, meaningful equity so you share in the upside of transformational technology, and top-tier health benefits that have you fully covered. We provide 16+ weeks of pregnancy leave top-up and a flexible vacation policy—because building transformational technology requires supporting the people who build it. More importantly, you'll work on technology that matters.
This role is based onsite to support the high security requirements of our clients and enable effective collaboration. We have a welcoming office environment, fully stocked with snacks, regular team outings (summer boat cruise, escape room, etc.), and a strong focus on maintaining a healthy work-life balance while doing meaningful, impactful work together.

Are you a technical product leader with the expertise to shape the future of AI-driven education? 2 Hour Learning seeks a technical architect to spearhead the evolution of our AI-powered learning platform. This position demands someone who possesses the technical depth to function as a CTO, the strategic product vision to catalyze transformational change, and the drive to apply those capabilities toward unlocking student potential at scale never before achieved.
While most organizations add AI to conventional education frameworks as a superficial enhancement, 2 Hour Learning has taken an entirely different approach: we've reconstructed the school model from its foundation, leveraging AI and learning science to fundamentally eliminate the limitations of traditional classrooms. Our students don't merely improve — they excel, earning multiple 4s and 5s on AP exams, demonstrating multi-year academic advancement within a single year, and routinely surpassing their own expectations. We've validated that when AI serves as the foundational operating system of learning, student performance reaches exponential levels.
This is not a conventional product management position centered on customer feedback cycles or gradual feature rollouts. This is an executive-level technical product ownership role, where you will command the architecture, technical strategy, and AI integration across our complete learning system. You'll be accountable for navigating the critical technical tradeoffs that keep our products lean, scalable, and uncompromisingly focused on elevating student outcomes. You will reason like a CTO while executing like a product entrepreneur, synthesizing engineering rigor with learning science principles to consistently deliver breakthroughs.
If you are prepared to drive the technical transformation of education itself and possess the executional discipline to realize that vision, we invite your application. This is your chance to architect the future of learning.
What You Will Be Doing
Cultivating and demonstrating comprehensive education product expertise to inform strategic decisions
Crafting technical specifications that resolve critical technical decisions while prioritizing simplicity, efficiency, and sustainable long-term architecture
Deploying generative AI technologies to automate and optimize engineering workflows, consistent with the strategic objective of minimizing manual effort
What You Won’t Be Doing
Pure people management; your technical and business judgment will be the defining elements of this role
Spending your time in meetings, committees, and administrative overhead; we have automated management burdens so you can concentrate on delivering business value through direct contribution
High-level strategies divorced from implementation detail; your recommendations must be grounded in product-level understanding
Vice President Of Product Engineering Key Responsibilities
Serve as the CTO for one or more education products, commanding core technical competencies and generating business value through flawless execution and strategic judgment
Basic Requirements
Deep experience or interest in data-driven learning science
7+ years of experience making the important architecture and design decisions on software projects, such as the application of architecture design patterns or significant open source technologies
2+ years of experience making design decisions involving the use of cloud computing services (primarily AWS)
4+ years of experience in positions with full technical and delivery ownership on a revenue-generating product
Experience building product features that make advanced use of Generative AI
Experience using Generative AI to simplify work processes
About 2 Hour Learning

Your role as Technical Product Manager (Scheduling and Forecasting)

Reporting to the Director of Engineering - Platform, you will play a critical role within the Scheduling & Forecasting team, whose mission is to power Dialogue’s operational backbone: forecasting demand, optimizing schedules, and matching members with the right clinician across every Canadian jurisdiction.
As a Technical Product Manager, you will own complex, system-heavy product initiatives at the intersection of data, algorithms, and backend platforms. You will work closely with senior engineers, data scientists, and operations teams to define, sequence, and deliver solutions that must work correctly at scale — not just look good on paper.

Partner deeply with Engineering, Data Science, and Platform teams to translate business and operational goals into technically feasible, scalable product strategies.
Lead product discovery with a strong technical lens, identifying system constraints, risks, and tradeoffs early (latency, cost, data quality, correctness, regulatory constraints).
Define clear product requirements, success metrics, and acceptance criteria for systems which may involve data pipelines, ML models, APIs, and backend services.
Collaborate with developers on solution design, sequencing, and rollout strategies, including incremental delivery, experimentation, and safe production launches.
Act as a bridge between technical and non-technical stakeholders, translating complex system behavior into clear narratives and decision-ready insights.
Own the end-to-end lifecycle of your initiatives, from problem framing and design through launch, monitoring, iteration, and long-term evolution.
Measure impact using operational, technical, and business metrics (e.g. forecast accuracy, scheduling efficiency, system reliability, cost-to-serve).
Help raise the overall product and technical maturity of the team by improving documentation, decision records, and product operating practices.
We'd love to hear from you if you have
3+ years of experience as a Product Manager, Technical Product Manager, or in a hybrid product/engineering role, owning complex technical systems end-to-end.
Strong technical fluency: you’re comfortable discussing architectures, data flows, APIs, and algorithms with senior engineers and data scientists.
Experience working on data-heavy, platform, or optimization-driven products (e.g. scheduling, forecasting, ML-powered systems, infra-adjacent products).
A track record of making sound tradeoffs under technical and operational constraints.
A data-centric mindset, with experience defining and evaluating success metrics for complex systems.
Excellent communication skills, with the ability to synthesize technical complexity into clear product direction.
Comfort operating in ambiguity, where problems are not fully defined and solutions evolve over time.
A collaborative, humble approach, and a strong sense of ownership for outcomes — not just outputs.
Nice To Have
Experience with ML or optimization systems in production.
Exposure to healthcare, regulated environments, or high-availability systems.

Be immersed in a talent-dense environment and greatly accelerate your career growth
About The Opportunity
Jerry is looking for a Senior Associate, Business Operations to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years — scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a Senior Associate, Business Operations, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company’s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the business operations & analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.
Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible – insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc – a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we’ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot & voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.
Here's what an ex-McKinsey teammate has to say about joining Jerry:
""I’ve really enjoyed working at Jerry because it’s allowed me to flex the strategy muscles I built at McKinsey while also getting much closer to implementation. Unlike traditional consulting, I’m not just handing off a recommendation — I actually get to own the metrics, design A/B tests, and see how our strategies play out in the real world.
Jerry has a deeply data-driven culture. We A/B test everything, and there’s been a big investment in data infrastructure — from clean, well-structured data to a strong data engineering team that supports real decision-making. As a result, the data and BizOps team is seen as a core strategic partner within the company.
Another thing I’ve appreciated is the team itself. A lot of people here come from MBB, so I’ve still got the energy, sharp thinking, and high bar that I had at McKinsey — but now I also get to build, test, and iterate on the strategies I help develop. It’s a great mix of ownership, rigor, and impact.""
How You Will Make An Impact
Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies
Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies
Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth
Identify opportunities to automate manual processes and optimize operational efficiency 
Preferred Experience
Bachelor’s degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline
2+ years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in business analysis/operations
High level of comfort with SQL and/or running complex data analysis
Who You Are
You have a framework for problem solving and live by first principles
You are comfortable communicating with audiences varying from front-line employees to the company’s C-suite
You set a very high bar for yourself and for your team, and you are constantly pushing that bar higher in the pursuit of excellence
While we appreciate your interest and application, only applicants under consideration will be contacted.
