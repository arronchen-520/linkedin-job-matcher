Imagine if you could write Python code that doesn’t just move data—but moves the needle on how the modern insurance industry functions. You’re not building another feature flag for a SaaS dashboard. You’re writing backend systems that support machine learning models tasked with identifying truth (or at least a statistically reliable approximation of it) in an industry built on uncertainty: insurance.
This is not a vibe-based startup. It's a well-capitalized AI company where engineering decisions are consequential and the work is rooted in measurable outcomes. The product helps insurers detect fraudulent claims using a data-driven platform that aims to remove bias—because the stakes aren’t likes or clicks; they’re dollars and liability.
You’ll be the kind of engineer who prefers to spend time writing backend Python that automates infrastructure logic, builds internal tools, or glues together machine learning pipelines in AWS. Terraform is here, obviously. So are EC2, RDS, Lambda, and other expected acronyms. But what sets this apart is the opportunity to shape how it all functions—functionally.
And yes, this role is onsite, in Toronto or Vancouver. You’ll be around other engineers who care about systems, not just shipping tickets.
Required Skills & Experience
3–6 years of experience in software engineering, with real backend Python contributions—ideally building infrastructure tools, internal APIs, or deployment logic 
Solid experience with AWS tooling and a habit of understanding the why, not just the how 
Proven experience with infrastructure-as-code tooling like Terraform or AWS CDK 
Desired Skills & Experience
Comfort overseeing Monitoring and reliability
Familiarity with CI/CD tooling and systems that don’t fall apart under pressure Daily Responsibilities
Hands-On Engineering: 70%

About The Role
We’re seeking a GCP Data Analyst with deep expertise in BigQuery, strong SQL and Python skills, and a sharp analytical mindset to support both data validation initiatives and ongoing analytics work. This role is ideal for someone who can navigate large datasets, build robust queries, and identify inconsistencies with precision and insight.
The analyst will work across a variety of data workflows, from validating metrics during system migrations to supporting day-to-day data analysis and reporting needs. You’ll leverage advanced BigQuery features—such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioning strategies, and time series analysis—to ensure data integrity and surface meaningful insights. Comfort working in Python with data frames and relevant packages is also essential, particularly for tasks involving data manipulation, anomaly detection, or prototyping workflows.
A solid understanding of data engineering fundamentals and GCP infrastructure is important, as is the ability to read and interpret code in Java or Scala when collaborating with engineering teammates. Familiarity with Airflow (Composer) will help you understand orchestration logic, though this won’t be a core responsibility. Experience with BigQuery ML, anomaly detection frameworks, or Vertex AI is a plus.
Key Responsibilities:-
Write, optimize, and execute complex SQL queries in BigQuery to validate data accuracy, identify inconsistencies, and support analytics and reporting
Analyze large datasets to assess data quality, compare trends across systems, and surface anomalies or unexpected behaviors
Utilize advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioned tables, and joins to support scalable, high-performance analysis
Use Python (including data frames and relevant libraries) for exploratory analysis, data manipulation, and supporting validation workflows
Support time series analysis and, where applicable, anomaly detection using SQL or Python-based approaches

About Us: 
At Lemurian Labs, we’re reimagining the foundations of computing to make AI accessible to everyone. Our mission is to remove the limits of scale, hardware, and cost that hold back innovation, so the people solving humanity’s hardest problems can move faster.
We’re building a new kind of software stack: a hardware-agnostic platform that makes every system - from a laptop to a supercomputer - feel like one seamless engine. Developers can write once, run anywhere, and get state-of-the-art performance across any chip, any cloud, any scale. It’s a complete rethink of how software and hardware interact—designed for the era beyond Moore’s Law.
We’re not looking for the comfortable or the conventional; we’re looking for the bold. The engineers who crave frontier problems, who want to bend the limits of what’s possible, who see infrastructure not as a constraint but as a canvas. If you want to build the foundation for the next era of AI, and change what humanity can achieve in the process, join us.
About Us: 
We're looking for a Technical Product Manager who will work closely with our founders to shape, design, and execute the product strategy behind our next-gen AI platform. 
This is not a typical PM role. You’ll be working at the intersection of compilers, distributed runtimes, and developer experience, translating frontier technology into products that redefine how developers and enterprises train and serve AI models at scale. You will collaborate with teams cross-functionally to define what gets built, why it matters, and how it benefits our customers. 
You will be responsible for driving clarity in times of ambiguity, scoping complex work, validating product hypotheses, defining testable outcomes, and other related tasks. This is a high-impact, zero-to-one role for someone who thrives on building deeply technical products from first principles and wants to help reshape the future of AI infrastructure. 
You will want this role if you’re someone who loves operating at the edge of technology, product, and design, while obsessing over architecture, user experience, and adoption, and who wants to leave a lasting impact on how the world builds and deploys AI
What You'll Do
Identify and analyze AI workloads across various industries, understanding the infrastructure needs for large-scale model builders and enterprise AI teams
Define strategies for optimizing AI workloads using Lemurian's software stack, ensuring seamless integration with existing tools
Work closely with engineering teams to build products that accelerate AI development and deployment
Engage directly with enterprise AI teams, model builders, and developers to gather insights and translate them into impactful product features
Collaborate cross-functionally with engineering, marketing, and sales to ensure alignment and drive successful product adoption
Define and track key metrics to measure the impact of Lemurian's AI software solutions and drive continuous improvements
Stay current with the latest advancements in AI infrastructure, frameworks, and platforms to inform product decisions
Develop and execute go-to-market strategies for AI software products that leverage Lemurian's compiler and optimization capabilities
What You'll Bring
6+ years of product management experience in AI, cloud platforms, or developer tools
Deep understanding of AI model development, inference, and training platforms
Experience with AI workloads and infrastructure requirements for large-scale deployments
Strong technical knowledge of compilers, AI frameworks (TensorFlow/JAX, PyTorch, Triton, XLA, etc.), and cloud-native technologies
Ability to translate customer needs into actionable product features and drive execution in collaboration with engineering teams
Excellent communication skills with a proven ability to engage with technical and non-technical stakeholders
Track record of shipping successful products in fast-paced environments
Nice to have
Prior experience working in a high-growth startup environment
Hands-on experience with Python programming
Familiarity with cloud-native technologies (Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform) and optimization techniques for scalable AI workloads
Experience with GPU architectures and performance optimization
Background in developer tools or infrastructure products
Contributions to open-source AI or infrastructure projects
Personal Attributes
Customer-obsessed — you deeply understand user needs and build products people love
Self-driven — you take ownership and don't wait for permission to solve problems
Collaborative mindset — you work well across teams and help others succeed
Passionate about sustainability — you care about making AI more efficient and environmentally responsible
Clear communicator — you can explain complex technical concepts to both engineers and stakeholders
Strategic thinker — you balance long-term vision with near-term execution
Salary depends on experience and geographical location. 
This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, such as the candidate’s experience, knowledge, skills, and abilities, as well as internal equity among our team. 
Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus opportunities, medical, dental, and vision benefits; retirement savings plan; and supplemental wellness benefits.
Lemurian Labs ensures equal employment opportunity without discrimination or harassment based on race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, national origin, marital or domestic/civil partnership status, genetic information, citizenship status, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.
EOE
We may use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to support parts of the hiring process, such as reviewing applications, analyzing resumes, or assessing responses. These tools assist our recruitment team but do not replace human judgment. Final hiring decisions are ultimately made by humans. If you would like more information about how your data is processed, please contact us.

Applicants who require specialized accommodation are encouraged to contact accessibility@dialogue.co.
Your role as Technical Product Manager (Scheduling and Forecasting)
Our passion is to help people improve their well-being — and that starts with ensuring our care delivery systems are reliable, scalable, and intelligent.
Reporting to the Director of Engineering - Platform, you will play a critical role within the Scheduling & Forecasting team, whose mission is to power Dialogue’s operational backbone: forecasting demand, optimizing schedules, and matching members with the right clinician across every Canadian jurisdiction.
As a Technical Product Manager, you will own complex, system-heavy product initiatives at the intersection of data, algorithms, and backend platforms. You will work closely with senior engineers, data scientists, and operations teams to define, sequence, and deliver solutions that must work correctly at scale — not just look good on paper.
Your work will directly influence service-level objectives, provider utilization, fairness, system reliability, and our ability to continuously learn and improve from real-world data.
About The Scheduling And Forecasting Team
As Canada's leading virtual care provider, Dialogue is committed to helping millions of individuals improve their health and well-being. The Scheduling & Forecasting team powers the operational backbone that makes this possible: we build and run the systems that schedule our healthcare providers, forecast demand, and match patients with the right clinician across every Canadian jurisdiction. Our work directly influences SLAs, occupancy rates, provider workload balance, and the reduction of manual administrative effort across the company.
What You'll Be Doing
Own the product vision and roadmap for technically complex initiatives within the Scheduling & Forecasting domain (e.g. forecasting pipelines, optimization engines, real-time scheduling flows).
Partner deeply with Engineering, Data Science, and Platform teams to translate business and operational goals into technically feasible, scalable product strategies.
Lead product discovery with a strong technical lens, identifying system constraints, risks, and tradeoffs early (latency, cost, data quality, correctness, regulatory constraints).
Define clear product requirements, success metrics, and acceptance criteria for systems which may involve data pipelines, ML models, APIs, and backend services.
Collaborate with developers on solution design, sequencing, and rollout strategies, including incremental delivery, experimentation, and safe production launches.
Act as a bridge between technical and non-technical stakeholders, translating complex system behavior into clear narratives and decision-ready insights.
Own the end-to-end lifecycle of your initiatives, from problem framing and design through launch, monitoring, iteration, and long-term evolution.
Measure impact using operational, technical, and business metrics (e.g. forecast accuracy, scheduling efficiency, system reliability, cost-to-serve).
Help raise the overall product and technical maturity of the team by improving documentation, decision records, and product operating practices.
We'd love to hear from you if you have
3+ years of experience as a Product Manager, Technical Product Manager, or in a hybrid product/engineering role, owning complex technical systems end-to-end.
Strong technical fluency: you’re comfortable discussing architectures, data flows, APIs, and algorithms with senior engineers and data scientists.
Experience working on data-heavy, platform, or optimization-driven products (e.g. scheduling, forecasting, ML-powered systems, infra-adjacent products).
A track record of making sound tradeoffs under technical and operational constraints.
A data-centric mindset, with experience defining and evaluating success metrics for complex systems.
Excellent communication skills, with the ability to synthesize technical complexity into clear product direction.
Comfort operating in ambiguity, where problems are not fully defined and solutions evolve over time.
A collaborative, humble approach, and a strong sense of ownership for outcomes — not just outputs.
Nice To Have
Experience with ML or optimization systems in production.
Exposure to healthcare, regulated environments, or high-availability systems.
Background in engineering, data engineering, or applied data science.

AI Disclosure Statement
To ensure an efficient and fair review process, we utilize artificial intelligence tools to assist in the initial screening and assessment of applicants for this role.
Your role as a Staff Platform Developer, Backend 
We are seeking a Staff Platform Developer to provide technical leadership and drive the architecture of Dialogue’s next-generation scheduling and automation platform. You will define and evolve the core services, data flows, and distributed systems that orchestrate provider availability, automated assignment, shift reshuffling, and real-time booking logic across all operating regions.
This is a senior-most technical role within the Scheduling & Forecasting team. You will guide architectural direction, set engineering standards, and mentor other engineers while contributing directly to the most critical systems powering Dialogue’s operational backbone.
About The Scheduling And Forecasting Team
As Canada's leading virtual care provider, Dialogue is committed to helping millions of individuals improve their health and well-being. The Scheduling & Forecasting team powers the operational backbone that makes this possible: we build and run the systems that schedule our healthcare providers, forecast demand, and match patients with the right clinician across every Canadian jurisdiction. Our work directly influences SLAs, occupancy rates, provider workload balance, and the reduction of manual administrative effort across the company.
What You'll Be Doing
This role sits at the intersection of backend engineering, platform reliability, and applied optimization with the added expectation of setting architectural direction, pushing technical boundaries, and building long-lasting foundations. You’ll partner closely with data engineers, data scientists, and operations leaders to transform research ideas, solver outputs, and complex domain rules into scalable, robust, and transparent backend systems.
You’ll influence the evolution of our scheduling intelligence, ensuring our automation stack is not only correct and reliable today, but also extensible for future constraints, jurisdictions, and product directions.
Day-to-day You Will
Lead the architecture and evolution of backend services and APIs that drive scheduling automation, availability management, and real-time booking logic.
Design cross-service workflows and distributed orchestration patterns capable of handling high-volume updates, conflict resolution, and multi-jurisdiction scheduling rules.
Define the standards for integrating solver outputs (CP-SAT, linear optimization, custom heuristics) and forecasting signals into production systems with verifiable correctness and predictable performance.
Partner with Data Engineering and Data Analytics leadership to design shared interfaces, data contracts, and experimentation patterns that accelerate model-to-production cycles.
Establish and champion best practices for observability: structured logs, metrics, tracing, dashboards, and SLOs to ensure scheduling systems remain transparent, auditable, and dependable.
Mentor and guide engineers across the team through code reviews, pairing, architectural deep dives, and long-range technical planning.
Anticipate failure modes and design for resilience through idempotency, graceful degradation, fallback logic, deterministic state transitions, and rigorous operational readiness.
Collaborate with operations and medical leadership to incorporate real-world constraints into the architecture, ensuring scheduling outcomes remain fair, explainable, and aligned with clinical realities.
Initiate and lead strategic technical projects that raise the bar for performance, correctness, reliability, or developer experience within the team and adjacent streams.
We'd love to hear from you if you have
Bring deep backend engineering experience: services, APIs, distributed systems, events at a scale where correctness and reliability are critical.
Have led the design of automation-heavy systems, schedulers, decision engines, workforce-management platforms, or comparably complex domain systems.
Are comfortable integrating optimization logic (e.g., OR-Tools/CP-SAT) or ML outputs into production flows with strong guarantees.
Have significant experience with event-driven architectures, queues, workflow orchestrators, or state machines.
Think in terms of system design, failure modes, invariants, idempotency, and long-term maintainability.
Are fluent in modern engineering practices: CI/CD, version control, automated testing, observability stacks, performance analysis, and infrastructure-as-code.
Influence beyond code: shaping design patterns, engineering culture, and technical strategy across teams.
Thrive in cross-functional environments, collaborating closely with data scientists, data engineers, DevSecOps, and operations stakeholders.
Enjoy balancing pragmatism with long-term thinking, building systems that are simple, robust, and adaptable in a domain full of constraints and edge cases.
This role is a key technical pillar in transforming Dialogue’s scheduling ecosystem: from manual processes and fragmented logic to a unified, automated platform rooted in correctness, efficiency, fairness, and operational excellence. As a Staff Platform Developer, your architectural decisions and leadership will shape the foundation of provider scheduling and patient experience for years to come.
Please note that as we serve customers across Canada, bilingualism is essential for this position. You may be required to communicate in French and English.
At Dialogue, your well-being is our priority
Benefits
Taking care of others also means taking care of our team! Depending on your role and employment status, you could have access to the following benefits:
Access to the Dialogue app and virtual mental health support for you and your family

Titre: Développeur(se) Plateforme Expert(e), Backend
Date d’expiration: 5 décembre 2025
Dialogue est heureux d'offrir à ses employés des possibilités d'évolution au sein de notre équipe et nous sommes ravis de votre intérêt!
Votre rôle à titre de Développeur(se) logiciel expert(e), Backend
Nous recherchons un(e) Développeur(se) logiciel expert(e) pour assurer le leadership technique et diriger l'architecture de la plateforme de planification et d'automatisation de nouvelle génération de Dialogue. Vous définirez et ferez évoluer les services fondamentaux, les flux de données et les systèmes distribués qui orchestrent la disponibilité des prestataires, l'affectation automatisée, la réorganisation des quarts de travail et la logique de réservation en temps réel dans toutes les régions opérationnelles.
Il s'agit du rôle technique le plus senior au sein de l'équipe Planification et Prévisions. Vous guiderez l'orientation architecturale, établirez les normes d'ingénierie et encadrerez les autres ingénieurs tout en contribuant directement aux systèmes les plus critiques qui alimentent la colonne vertébrale opérationnelle de Dialogue.
À Propos de l'Équipe Planification et Prévisions
En tant que principal fournisseur de soins virtuels au Canada, Dialogue s'engage à aider des millions de personnes à améliorer leur santé et leur bien-être. L'équipe Planification et Prévisions alimente la colonne vertébrale opérationnelle qui rend cela possible : nous construisons et gérons les systèmes qui planifient nos prestataires de soins de santé, prévoient la demande et mettent en relation les patients avec le bon clinicien dans chaque juridiction canadienne. Notre travail influence directement les SLA (accords de niveau de service), les taux d'occupation, l'équilibre de la charge de travail des prestataires et la réduction de l'effort administratif manuel à travers l'entreprise.
Vos responsabilités
Ce rôle se situe à l'intersection de l'ingénierie backend, de la fiabilité de la plateforme et de l'optimisation appliquée, avec l'attente supplémentaire de définir l'orientation architecturale, de repousser les limites techniques et de construire des fondations durables. Vous travaillerez en étroite collaboration avec les ingénieurs de données, les scientifiques de données et les responsables des opérations pour transformer les idées de recherche, les résultats d'optimisation (solver outputs) et les règles complexes du domaine en systèmes backend évolutifs, robustes et transparents.
Vous influencerez l'évolution de notre intelligence de planification, en vous assurant que notre solution d'automatisation est non seulement exacte et fiable aujourd'hui, mais également extensible pour les futures contraintes, juridictions et orientations produits.
Au Quotidien, Vous Allez
Diriger l'architecture et l'évolution des services et API backend qui pilotent l'automatisation de la planification, la gestion de la disponibilité et la logique de réservation en temps réel.
Concevoir des flux de travail inter-services et des modèles d'orchestration distribuée capables de gérer les mises à jour à volume élevé, la résolution des conflits et les règles de planification multi-juridictionnelles.
Définir les normes pour l'intégration des résultats d'optimisation (CP-SAT, optimisation linéaire, heuristiques personnalisées) et des signaux de prévisions dans les systèmes de production avec une exactitude vérifiable et des performances prévisibles.
Collaborer avec la direction de l'Ingénierie des Données et de l'Analyse des Données pour concevoir des interfaces partagées, des contrats de données et des modèles d'expérimentation qui accélèrent les cycles de passage du modèle à la production.
Établir et promouvoir les meilleures pratiques d'observabilité : logs structurés, métriques, traçage, tableaux de bord et SLO (objectifs de niveau de service) pour garantir que les systèmes de planification restent transparents, auditables et fiables.
Encadrer et guider les ingénieurs de l'équipe par le biais de revues de code, de programmation en binôme, d'analyses architecturales approfondies et de planification technique à long terme.
Anticiper les modes de défaillance et concevoir en vue de la résilience par l'idempotence, la dégradation gracieuse, la logique de repli, les transitions d'état déterministes et une préparation opérationnelle rigoureuse.
Collaborer avec la direction des opérations et la direction médicale pour incorporer les contraintes du monde réel dans l'architecture, en garantissant que les résultats de planification restent équitables, explicables et alignés sur les réalités cliniques.
Initier et diriger des projets techniques stratégiques qui améliorent la performance, l'exactitude, la fiabilité ou l'expérience développeur au sein de l'équipe et des flux adjacents.
Nous aimerions beaucoup vous rencontrer si vous possédez 
Avez une expérience approfondie en ingénierie backend : services, API, systèmes distribués, événements à une échelle où l'exactitude et la fiabilité sont critiques.
Avez dirigé la conception de systèmes fortement automatisés, de planificateurs (schedulers), de moteurs de décision, de plateformes de gestion des effectifs ou de systèmes de domaine d'une complexité comparable.
Êtes à l'aise avec l'intégration de la logique d'optimisation (par exemple, OR-Tools/CP-SAT) ou des résultats de ML (apprentissage automatique) dans des flux de production avec de solides garanties.
Avez une expérience significative des architectures événementielles, des files d'attente (queues), des orchestrateurs de flux de travail ou des machines à états.
Pensez en termes de conception de systèmes, de modes de défaillance, d'invariants, d'idempotence et de maintenabilité à long terme.
Maîtrisez les pratiques d'ingénierie modernes : CI/CD, contrôle de version, tests automatisés, piles d'observabilité, analyse des performances et infrastructure en tant que code.
Exercez une influence au-delà du code : façonnant les modèles de conception, la culture d'ingénierie et la stratégie technique à travers les équipes.
Vous épanouissez dans des environnements interfonctionnels, collaborant étroitement avec les scientifiques de données, les ingénieurs de données, les équipes DevSecOps et les parties prenantes opérationnelles.
Aimez équilibrer le pragmatisme et la vision à long terme, en construisant des systèmes simples, robustes et adaptables dans un domaine plein de contraintes et de cas limites.
Ce rôle est un pilier technique clé dans la transformation de l'écosystème de planification de Dialogue : passant de processus manuels et d'une logique fragmentée à une plateforme unifiée et automatisée ancrée dans l'exactitude, l'efficacité, l'équité et l'excellence opérationnelle. En tant que Développeur(se) logiciel expert(e), vos décisions architecturales et votre leadership façonneront la fondation de la planification des prestataires et de l'expérience patient pour les années à venir.
