Our Purpose
As we expand our AI capabilities, we seek an AI Architect to shape responsible, scalable, and innovative AI systems for Marketing Technology.
Overview
We are seeking an AI Architect to lead the design of next-generation enterprise AI systems centered on Agentic AI, advanced RAG patterns, multimodal model integration, and secure orchestration frameworks. This role focuses entirely on model integration, inference optimization, safety, orchestration, document ingestion, evaluation, and architecture. The architect will drive standards for multi-agent orchestration, tool calling, governance, and design patterns across business and engineering teams.
AI Strategy, Architecture & Governance
The AI Architect will define enterprise AI architecture that incorporates Agentic RAG, Graph RAG, Master-Agent orchestration, A2A agent communication, and MCP-based extensibility with tool calling. This involves shaping standards for how agents plan, reason, ground their responses, call tools safely, and collaborate autonomously. The role establishes architectural guardrails for tool schemas, action validation, lineage tracking, and auditability. It also sets direction for LLMOps and AgentOps patterns, ensuring alignment with data governance, responsible AI frameworks, and enterprise security requirements.
AI Solution Architecture
This role leads the end-to-end architecture of AI applications such as intelligent copilots, autonomous agents, workflow orchestration systems, knowledge-grounded assistants, and agentic marketing solutions. The architect integrates open-source and commercial LLMs, Vision-LLMs (e.g., Florence‑2, LLaVA, Qwen-VL), and diffusion models for text‑to‑image and emerging text‑to‑video capabilities. Rather than training models, the architect ensures secure, optimized inference and efficient orchestration using frameworks like vLLM, TGI, Hugging Face pipelines, and Databricks-first pipelines for governance (Unity Catalog), lineage tracking (MLflow), and semantic retrieval (Databricks Vector Search). Tool calling plays a central role as the architectural pattern for enabling LLMs and agents to safely interact with enterprise systems, APIs, knowledge stores, and other agents.
Knowledge Base Ingestion (PPT/PDF) Pipeline Architecture
The architect designs standardized, scalable ingestion workflows for enterprise PPT/PDF content using tools such as Unstructured.io, MarkItDown, Apache Tika, PyMuPDF, and python‑pptx. These pipelines incorporate OCR and layout understanding through LayoutParser, docTR, PaddleOCR, and OpenCV, as well as Vision-LLMs for interpreting charts, diagrams, and complex layouts. Ingestion workflows support semantic chunking, metadata enrichment, table extraction, media handling, and slide-aware structuring, all governed through Unity Catalog with indexing and retrieval powered by Databricks Vector Search. Tool calling is incorporated to allow agents to retrieve, interpret, or update knowledge assets securely and dynamically.
AI Safety, Guardrails & Evaluation
The AI Architect leads the design of safety, grounding, and evaluation systems using frameworks like DeepTeam and NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails to enforce policy constraints, reduce hallucinations, ensure topic control, and maintain safe conversational boundaries. Evaluation strategies include DeepEval for behavioral and correctness testing, Ragas for RAG performance metrics, and human‑in‑the‑loop validation for high-stakes workflows. The role ensures every agent and LLM-powered system adheres to Responsible AI, data protection, and compliance frameworks, with robust logging, lineage, and auditability.
Technical Leadership
The AI Architect provides thought leadership across engineering, data, and product teams, creating reference architectures for AgentOps, RAG frameworks, tool calling patterns, ingestion pipelines, and evaluation standards. They guide architectural reviews, mentor teams on best practices for prompt design, grounding, safety, and workflow orchestration, and communicate complex AI strategies to both technical and executive stakeholders. The role requires strong judgment, clear articulation of trade-offs, and the ability to influence across multiple domains without direct authority.
All About You
You bring deep experience designing AI systems built on Agentic RAG, Graph RAG, multi-agent orchestration, and structured tool calling. You are skilled in integrating LLMs, Vision-LLMs, and diffusion models for inference and multimodal understanding, and you’re comfortable architecting secure, compliant pipelines using platforms like Databricks ML, Unity Catalog, MLflow, and Databricks Vector Search. You have hands-on expertise with document ingestion frameworks for PPT/PDF content, OCR and layout tools, semantic chunking, and multimodal enrichment. You excel at bridging business, engineering, and governance perspectives, and you are committed to Responsible AI and secure enterprise design.
Corporate Security Responsibilities
All AI systems must comply with security, privacy, and model governance standards. This includes safeguarding sensitive data, following security policies, reporting incidents promptly, and completing required compliance and AI safety training.

Why This Role Is Different
Role
This is not a typical “Applied Scientist” or “ML Engineer” role. As a Member of Technical Staff, Applied ML, you will:
Work directly with enterprise customers on problems that push LLMs to their limits. You’ll rapidly understand customer domains, design custom LLM solutions, and deliver production-ready models that solve high-value, real-world problems.
Train and customize frontier models — not just use APIs. You’ll leverage Cohere’s full stack: CPT, post-training, retrieval + agent integrations, model evaluations, and SOTA modeling techniques.
Influence the capabilities of Cohere’s foundation models. Techniques, datasets, evaluations, and insights you develop for customers will directly shape the next generation of Cohere’s frontier models.
Operate with an early-startup level of ownership inside a frontier-model company. This role combines the breadth of an early-stage CTO with the infrastructure and scale of a deep-learning lab.
Wear multiple hats, set a high technical bar, and define what Applied ML at Cohere becomes. Few roles in the industry combine application, research, customer-facing engineering, and core-model influence as directly as this one.
What You’ll Do
Technical Leadership & Solution Design
Contribute to the design and delivery of custom LLM solutions for enterprise customers.
Translate ambiguous business problems into well-framed ML problems with clear success criteria and evaluation methodologies.
Modeling, Customization & Foundations Contribution
Build custom models using Cohere’s foundation model stack, CPT recipes, post-training pipelines (including RLVR), and data assets.
Develop SOTA modeling techniques that directly enhance model performance for customer use-cases.
Contribute improvements back to the foundation-model stack — including new capabilities, tuning strategies, and evaluation frameworks.
Customer-Facing Technical Impact
Work as part of Cohere’s customer facing MLE team to identify high-value opportunities where LLMs can unlock transformative impact to our enterprise customers.
You May Be a Good Fit If You Have
Technical Foundations
Strong ML fundamentals and the ability to frame complex, ambiguous problems as ML solutions.
Fluency with Python and core ML/LLM frameworks.
Experience working with (or the ability to learn) large-scale datasets and distributed training or inference pipelines.
Understanding of LLM architectures, tuning techniques (CPT, post-training), and evaluation methodologies.
Demonstrated ability to meaningfully shape LLM performance.
Experience & Leadership
A broad view of the ML research landscape and a desire to push the state of the art.
Mindset
Bias toward action, high ownership, and comfort with ambiguity.
Humility and strong collaboration instincts.
A deep conviction that AI should meaningfully empower people and organizations.
Join Us
This is a pivotal moment in Cohere’s history. As an MTS in Applied ML, you will define not only what we build — but how the world experiences AI. If you're excited about building custom models, solving generational problems for global organizations, and shaping frontier-model capabilities, we’d love to meet you.
If some of the above doesn’t line up perfectly with your experience, we still encourage you to apply!
We value and celebrate diversity and strive to create an inclusive work environment for all. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and are committed to providing equal opportunities. Should you require any accommodations during the recruitment process, please submit an Accommodations Request Form, and we will work together to meet your needs.

This is not a typical “Applied Scientist” or “ML Engineer” role. As a Member of Technical Staff, Applied ML, you will:
Work directly with enterprise customers on problems that push LLMs to their limits. You’ll rapidly understand customer domains, design custom LLM solutions, and deliver production-ready models that solve high-value, real-world problems.
Train and customize frontier models — not just use APIs. You’ll leverage Cohere’s full stack: CPT, post-training, retrieval + agent integrations, model evaluations, and SOTA modeling techniques.
Influence the capabilities of Cohere’s foundation models. Techniques, datasets, evaluations, and insights you develop for customers will directly shape the next generation of Cohere’s frontier models.
Operate with an early-startup level of ownership inside a frontier-model company. This role combines the breadth of an early-stage CTO with the infrastructure and scale of a deep-learning lab.
Wear multiple hats, set a high technical bar, and define what Applied ML at Cohere becomes. Few roles in the industry combine application, research, customer-facing engineering, and core-model influence as directly as this one.
What You’ll Do
Technical Leadership & Solution Design
Lead the design and delivery of custom LLM solutions for enterprise customers.
Translate ambiguous business problems into well-framed ML problems with clear success criteria and evaluation methodologies.
Modeling, Customization & Foundations Contribution
Build custom models using Cohere’s foundation model stack, CPT recipes, post-training pipelines (including RLVR), and data assets.
Develop SOTA modeling techniques that directly enhance model performance for customer use-cases.
Contribute improvements back to the foundation-model stack — including new capabilities, tuning strategies, and evaluation frameworks.
Customer-Facing Technical Impact
Work closely with enterprise customers to identify high-value opportunities where LLMs can unlock transformative impact.
Provide technical leadership across discovery, scoping, modeling, deployment, agent workflows, and post-deployment iteration.
Establish evaluation frameworks and success metrics for custom modeling engagements.
Team Mentorship & Organizational Impact
Mentor engineers across distributed teams.
Drive clarity in ambiguous situations, build alignment, and raise engineering and modeling quality across the organization.
You May Be a Good Fit If You Have
Technical Foundations
Strong ML fundamentals and the ability to frame complex, ambiguous problems as ML solutions.
Fluency with Python and core ML/LLM frameworks.
Experience working with large-scale datasets and distributed training or inference pipelines.
Understanding of LLM architectures, tuning techniques (CPT, post-training), and evaluation methodologies.
Demonstrated ability to meaningfully shape LLM performance.
Experience & Leadership
Experience engaging directly with customers or stakeholders to design and deliver ML-powered solutions.
A track record of technical leadership at a team level.
A broad view of the ML research landscape and a desire to push the state of the art.
Mindset
Bias toward action, high ownership, and comfort with ambiguity.
Humility and strong collaboration instincts.
A deep conviction that AI should meaningfully empower people and organizations.
Join Us
This is a pivotal moment in Cohere’s history. As an MTS in Applied ML, you will define not only what we build — but how the world experiences AI. If you're excited about building custom models, solving generational problems for global organizations, and shaping frontier-model capabilities, we’d love to meet you.

Our Purpose
As we expand our AI capabilities, we seek an AI Architect to shape responsible, scalable, and innovative AI systems for Marketing Technology.
Overview
We are seeking an AI Architect to lead the design of next-generation enterprise AI systems centered on Agentic AI, advanced RAG patterns, multimodal model integration, and secure orchestration frameworks. This role focuses entirely on model integration, inference optimization, safety, orchestration, document ingestion, evaluation, and architecture. The architect will drive standards for multi-agent orchestration, tool calling, governance, and design patterns across business and engineering teams.
AI Strategy, Architecture & Governance
The AI Architect will define enterprise AI architecture that incorporates Agentic RAG, Graph RAG, Master-Agent orchestration, A2A agent communication, and MCP-based extensibility with tool calling. This involves shaping standards for how agents plan, reason, ground their responses, call tools safely, and collaborate autonomously. The role establishes architectural guardrails for tool schemas, action validation, lineage tracking, and auditability. It also sets direction for LLMOps and AgentOps patterns, ensuring alignment with data governance, responsible AI frameworks, and enterprise security requirements.
AI Solution Architecture
This role leads the end-to-end architecture of AI applications such as intelligent copilots, autonomous agents, workflow orchestration systems, knowledge-grounded assistants, and agentic marketing solutions. The architect integrates open-source and commercial LLMs, Vision-LLMs (e.g., Florence‑2, LLaVA, Qwen-VL), and diffusion models for text‑to‑image and emerging text‑to‑video capabilities. Rather than training models, the architect ensures secure, optimized inference and efficient orchestration using frameworks like vLLM, TGI, Hugging Face pipelines, and Databricks-first pipelines for governance (Unity Catalog), lineage tracking (MLflow), and semantic retrieval (Databricks Vector Search). Tool calling plays a central role as the architectural pattern for enabling LLMs and agents to safely interact with enterprise systems, APIs, knowledge stores, and other agents.
Knowledge Base Ingestion (PPT/PDF) Pipeline Architecture
The architect designs standardized, scalable ingestion workflows for enterprise PPT/PDF content using tools such as Unstructured.io, MarkItDown, Apache Tika, PyMuPDF, and python‑pptx. These pipelines incorporate OCR and layout understanding through LayoutParser, docTR, PaddleOCR, and OpenCV, as well as Vision-LLMs for interpreting charts, diagrams, and complex layouts. Ingestion workflows support semantic chunking, metadata enrichment, table extraction, media handling, and slide-aware structuring, all governed through Unity Catalog with indexing and retrieval powered by Databricks Vector Search. Tool calling is incorporated to allow agents to retrieve, interpret, or update knowledge assets securely and dynamically.
AI Safety, Guardrails & Evaluation
The AI Architect leads the design of safety, grounding, and evaluation systems using frameworks like DeepTeam and NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails to enforce policy constraints, reduce hallucinations, ensure topic control, and maintain safe conversational boundaries. Evaluation strategies include DeepEval for behavioral and correctness testing, Ragas for RAG performance metrics, and human‑in‑the‑loop validation for high-stakes workflows. The role ensures every agent and LLM-powered system adheres to Responsible AI, data protection, and compliance frameworks, with robust logging, lineage, and auditability.
Technical Leadership
The AI Architect provides thought leadership across engineering, data, and product teams, creating reference architectures for AgentOps, RAG frameworks, tool calling patterns, ingestion pipelines, and evaluation standards. They guide architectural reviews, mentor teams on best practices for prompt design, grounding, safety, and workflow orchestration, and communicate complex AI strategies to both technical and executive stakeholders. The role requires strong judgment, clear articulation of trade-offs, and the ability to influence across multiple domains without direct authority.
All About You
You bring deep experience designing AI systems built on Agentic RAG, Graph RAG, multi-agent orchestration, and structured tool calling. You are skilled in integrating LLMs, Vision-LLMs, and diffusion models for inference and multimodal understanding, and you’re comfortable architecting secure, compliant pipelines using platforms like Databricks ML, Unity Catalog, MLflow, and Databricks Vector Search. You have hands-on expertise with document ingestion frameworks for PPT/PDF content, OCR and layout tools, semantic chunking, and multimodal enrichment. You excel at bridging business, engineering, and governance perspectives, and you are committed to Responsible AI and secure enterprise design.
Corporate Security Responsibilities
All AI systems must comply with security, privacy, and model governance standards. This includes safeguarding sensitive data, following security policies, reporting incidents promptly, and completing required compliance and AI safety training.

BMO Capital Markets is a leading, full-service financial services provider. We offer corporate and investment banking, treasury management, as well as research and advisory services to clients around the world. #bmocapitalmarkets
About the Role:
We’re looking for a pragmatic, detail-oriented Software Engineer to help build and maintain our Quantitative Investment Strategy (QIS) Calculation Engine — the core platform that powers the calculation of quantitative indices (levels and decompositions), risk modeling, scenario analysis and prototyping across Global Markets. You’ll work across a modern C# codebase with critical Python interop for research pipelines, numerical routines, quick prototyping, backtesting, and data science tooling. Expect to collaborate closely with quants, traders, and software engineers to deliver resilient, event driven, auditable systems at scale.
What You’ll Do:
Own the engine: Design, implement, and optimize components of the QIS engine (e.g., factor models, signal pipelines, backtesting, scenario analysis, portfolio optimization).
Interop & integrations: Build robust C#/Python interop layers (Pythonnet or equivalent) to bridge production services with research scripts generated by quant team.
Data engineering for quant: Develop reliable market data ingestion, normalization, and metadata/versioning (symbols, corporate actions).
Performance & reliability: Profile and tune CPU/memory, parallelism (TPL/async), caching, and I/O; ensure deterministic, reproducible runs with comprehensive logging and telemetry.
Model lifecycle management: Operationalize quant models—parameterization, configuration, feature flags, release management, and controlled experiment frameworks.
Testing & quality: Implement rigorous unit/integration tests, regression suites against golden datasets, and CI/CD pipelines.
Risk & compliance: Embed controls for auditability, explainability, and traceability of results; support model validation and governance that conforms to BMO standards.
Collaboration: Partner with quants on specification and model translation; work with team on deployment, observability, and production incident response.
Qualifications
Must-have
3+ years professional software engineering experience in C#/.NET building production services/libraries.
Previous experience in Python with an emphasis on Python internals.
Strong knowledge of software architecture and distributed systems: APIs, messaging, concurrency, resiliency patterns, configuration management.
Hands-on experience with Python for numerical computing (NumPy, pandas, SciPy).
Solid CS fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, complexity analysis, threads/async, networking, serialization.
Database experience: RDMS (PostgreSQL/MSSQL) fundamentals as well as experience in building queries, database design and optimizing/tuning DB for performance.
Familiarity with market data: time series, corporate actions, calendars, B-PIPE.
Nice-to-have
Experience in finance: quantitative investment models, factor investing, portfolio optimization (e.g., mean-variance, risk parity), transaction cost modeling.
Performance profiling (BenchmarkDotNet, dotTrace, perf counters), and high-performance C# (Span/Memory, SIMD, channels).
Experience with on-prem infrastructure (dedicated VMs, Ansible, etc...), secrets management, and observability (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus/Grafana, ELK).
Exposure to modern C# features (.NET 8+), and design patterns for domain-driven design.
Database experience: columnar/time-series stores (Parquet/Delta/InfluxDB/Kdb+/OneTick) a plus.
Proficiency in testing and CI/CD: xUnit/NUnit, test containers, GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps or similar.
What Success Looks Like (6–12 Months)
Enhance the QIS engine’s index calculation throughput and increase the speed at which new indices can be added within the engine
Deliver a clean interop layer with clear contracts and automated validation between Python and production C#.
Develop and ship at least one new quantitative investment strategy with demonstrable notional attribution.
Our Tech Stack
Core: C#/.NET 8 with ASP.NET Core, on-prem VMs, IIS
Interop: Python (NumPy/pandas/SciPy) with Pythonnet
Tooling: Azure DevOps, OpenTelemetry
Testing: xUnit/NUnit
Why Join Us
Impact at scale: Your work powers real strategies, capital deployment, and risk decisions across Global Markets.
R&D velocity: Tight feedback loops with quants and traders; pragmatic engineering over theory.
Modern stack & autonomy: Greenfield opportunities; strong ownership and room to innovate.

About Us: 
At Lemurian Labs, we’re reimagining the foundations of computing to make AI accessible to everyone. Our mission is to remove the limits of scale, hardware, and cost that hold back innovation, so the people solving humanity’s hardest problems can move faster.
We’re building a new kind of software stack: a hardware-agnostic platform that makes every system - from a laptop to a supercomputer - feel like one seamless engine.

Develop and execute go-to-market strategies for AI software products that leverage Lemurian's compiler and optimization capabilities
What You'll Bring
6+ years of product management experience in AI, cloud platforms, or developer tools
Deep understanding of AI model development, inference, and training platforms
Experience with AI workloads and infrastructure requirements for large-scale deployments
Strong technical knowledge of compilers, AI frameworks (TensorFlow/JAX, PyTorch, Triton, XLA, etc.), and cloud-native technologies
Ability to translate customer needs into actionable product features and drive execution in collaboration with engineering teams
Excellent communication skills with a proven ability to engage with technical and non-technical stakeholders
Track record of shipping successful products in fast-paced environments
Nice to have
Prior experience working in a high-growth startup environment
Hands-on experience with Python programming
Familiarity with cloud-native technologies (Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform) and optimization techniques for scalable AI workloads
Experience with GPU architectures and performance optimization
Background in developer tools or infrastructure products
Contributions to open-source AI or infrastructure projects
Personal Attributes
Customer-obsessed — you deeply understand user needs and build products people love
Self-driven — you take ownership and don't wait for permission to solve problems
Collaborative mindset — you work well across teams and help others succeed
Passionate about sustainability — you care about making AI more efficient and environmentally responsible
Clear communicator — you can explain complex technical concepts to both engineers and stakeholders
Strategic thinker — you balance long-term vision with near-term execution
Salary depends on experience and geographical location. 
This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, such as the candidate’s experience, knowledge, skills, and abilities, as well as internal equity among our team. 
Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus opportunities, medical, dental, and vision benefits; retirement savings plan; and supplemental wellness benefits.

This role is for a technical product leader prepared to drive the reinvention of education through AI. 2 Hour Learning seeks an architect with the depth to lead the modernization of our AI-powered learning ecosystem. You will need the technical expertise to function as a CTO, the strategic vision to catalyze transformational change, and the commitment to deploy these capabilities to unlock student potential at scale.
While most organizations add AI to conventional education systems as a superficial enhancement, 2 Hour Learning has pursued a fundamentally different approach: we have reconstructed the entire school model, leveraging AI and learning science to eliminate the limitations of the traditional classroom. Our students don't merely progress — they excel, earning multiple 4s and 5s on AP exams, demonstrating multi-year academic advancement within a single year, and regularly surpassing their own projected outcomes. We have validated that when AI serves as the foundational operating system for learning, student performance accelerates dramatically.
This is not a conventional product management position centered on customer feedback cycles or gradual feature rollouts. This is an executive-level technical product ownership role in which you will control the architecture, technical roadmap, and AI integration across our complete learning platform. You will make the difficult technical trade-offs necessary to keep our products lean, scalable, and relentlessly oriented toward student outcome improvement. You will think with the rigor of a CTO while executing with the agility of a product entrepreneur, fusing engineering discipline with learning science principles to drive continuous innovation.
If you are prepared to lead the technical transformation of education and possess the operational discipline to support that vision, we invite your application. This is your chance to shape the future of learning.
What You Will Be Doing
Sustaining and demonstrating comprehensive education product expertise to inform strategic decisions
Creating technical specifications that resolve critical technical decisions and emphasize simplicity, efficiency, and long-term sustainability
Deploying generative AI technologies to automate and optimize engineering workflows, consistent with the strategic objective of minimizing manual effort
What You Won’t Be Doing
Pure people management; this position demands your business judgment and technical expertise as primary drivers
Spending time on meetings, committees, and administrative overhead; we have automated management burdens to enable focus on delivering business value through direct contribution
High-level strategic recommendations without actionable implementation guidance; your proposals must be grounded in product-level detail
Vice President Of Product Engineering Key Responsibilities
Serve as the CTO for one or more education products, owning core technical competencies and generating business value through flawless execution and strategic leadership
Basic Requirements
Substantial experience or demonstrated interest in data-driven learning science
7+ years of experience making critical architecture and design decisions on software projects, including the application of architecture design patterns or major open source technologies
2+ years of experience making design decisions that involve cloud computing services (primarily AWS)
4+ years of experience in roles with complete technical and delivery ownership of a revenue-generating product
Experience developing product features that leverage advanced use of Generative AI
Experience applying Generative AI to streamline work processes
