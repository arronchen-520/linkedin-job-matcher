Scalable Automation: Implement and oversee automated experimentation workflows using Adobe Target?€?s AI/ML capabilities to dynamically serve the highest-performing experiences to specific users at scale.
Audience Architecture: Partner cross-functionally within and beyond our Digital team to define and build high-value audiences within Adobe Target based on firmographics, intent data, and user behavior.
Technical Orchestration: Translate complex business requirements into technical specs for our engineering partners.

QA & Governance: Conduct rigorous T&O QA to ensure personalized experiences render flawlessly across various segments and devices.
Strategic Communication: Lead performance reviews that go beyond data reporting; provide ""the story"" of how personalization is shortening the sales cycle and improving the user journey.
Necessary Experience
5+ years of growth/experimentation experience with a heavy emphasis on segmentation-based testing.
Adobe Target Mastery: Deep hands-on experience with Adobe Target, specifically leveraging Experience Targeting (XT) and Auto-Target features to deliver real-time personalized content.

Technical Liaison: Proven ability to communicate data layer requirements and tag implementation needs to developers to unlock deeper personalization triggers.
Stakeholder Management: Experience presenting complex ""personalization-first"" strategies to executive leadership, focusing on long-term scalability rather than just quick wins.
Preferred Experience
B2B Personalization: Experience in a B2B environment using tools like Marketo, Clay, CommonRoom, Demandbase and 6sense in conjunction with Adobe Target.
AI/ML Optimization: Familiarity with using Adobe Target?€?s AI capabilities to automate the discovery of the best-performing experience for each individual visitor.
Visual Stack: Experience with Tableau to visualize user friction points that personalization can solve.
